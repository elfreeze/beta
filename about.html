  <h1>About Me!</h1>
    <p>
      This is the page that tells you the story of my life in the 3rd person. Hopefully by the end of my life someone may write a biography of me. This page shall be updated frequently as more events unfold. Happy Reading!!!
    </p>
    <h3>A Short Bio!</h3>
    <p>
      Born in the gracious city of "Suleja" in 1993, the city that was righteously known as "AbuJa" before the name was borrowed by the Federal Capital Territory, Hafeez's main ambition is to become an Electrical/Computer Engineer at a very young age.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hafeez currently works as a teacher in two public schools; a primary and a secondary school in Niger State of Nigeria. He teaches Primary school Mathematics and Basic Technology for Junior Secondary school.
    </p>
    <p>
      He uses most of his time after work to work on his internet projects which initially started as a hubby that has now grown into a side-hustle. He uses the extra income to expand his knowledge in computers, in general, A.I. (Artificial Intelligence) and M.L. (Machine Learning) in particular.
    </p>
    <p>
      He strongly loves Basketball. He plays the game and watches most of Lakers and Warriors games`. His favorite players are the Late Kobe Bryant (RIP Kobe) and Steph Curry. His other hobbies are reading and learning new things.
    </p>
    <h3>Brief Biography!</h3>
    <p>
      Hafeez Abdul was born as Abdul-Hafiz Abdullahi in the Dawaki area of "Suleja" on 1st July, 1993. At a very young age, Hafeez's main ambition is to become an Electrical/Computer Engineer.
    </p>
    <p>
      He never had a computer of his own when growing up  because his family couldn't afford one then. His first sight of a computer was back at Primary School when the computer teacher decided to organize a little practical for the kids of his class. Every kid was made to type his/her name into the Microsoft word program deligently opened by the teacher. Any deviation by a kid from the opened program then will be a crime and could be punished severely as the teacher is scared of causing harm to the system.
    </p>
    <p>
      That experience was far back in 2002. That single encounter with the computer made him score a 100% in Computer Science for that term and subsequent ones. His performance attracted his uncle's attention who owns a Computer Cafe. He invited Hafeez to the Cafe and granted him full privilege of using the systems there. First, Hafeez watched and watched how the computer was being operated until he was able to know how to operate one. When he was familiar with the functions, he decided to a create a mini project.
    </p> 
    <p>
      In fact, he created a lot of mini projects but the most beloved of all was a very beautiful list of his family members. All these was done on an old HP Pc with a Pentium processor and 128mb of RAM (outdated in today's terms), when he was just 8 years old at a time when kids of his age don't even know how a computer looks like.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hafeez is an avid reader of novels that have read over fifty (50) books before graduating from Primary School. He doesn't go anywhere without a book stocked to the pockets of his shorts. The tradition continued upto Tertiary institution where he helps others become fluent in the English Language.
    </p>
    <p>
      His first encounter with the internet was in 2009 when he escorted a friend to a cybercafe to check Football news and watch some highlights. That first glimpse of <a class="links" href="https://www.tribalfootball.com/">Tribalfootball.com</a> and <a class="links" href="https://www.goal.com/">goal.com</a> sparked an obsession far greater than the one he has with his books. This encounter contributed immensely towards his ambition to become a Computer Programmer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hafeez currently works as a teacher in two public schools; a primary and a secondary school in Niger State of Nigeria. He teaches Primary school Mathematics and Basic Technology for Junior Secondary school.
